      Hazelcast is an open-source, distributed, in-memory data grid (IMDG) solution that provides highly scalable and fault-tolerant data processing capabilities. 
      It is designed to distribute data across multiple nodes in a cluster, allowing applications to easily scale horizontally and process large amounts of data in parallel. 
      Hazelcast provides distributed data structures and APIs for caching, distributed computing, event processing, and messaging, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases, including caching, real-time analytics, financial services, gaming, e-commerce, and more.
